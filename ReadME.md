Assignment 4

Description:

Read the following:

http://alistapart.com/article/git-the-safety-net-for-your-projects  (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. - about Git, optional
http://www.creativebloq.com/typography/rules-web-typography-learn-rules-type-setting-web-2131890 (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. - intro to typography for the web
http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-normalize-css/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. - why normalize.css is awesome. Download it (https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.)
Download it: Meyers reset (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
Include either CSS reset in your project. It should be the very first stylesheet you link to in your HTML <head> element.
Finish creating the code for the mockup we started in class (files in Lesson 04 Overview if you need them). Getting your page to appear just like the provided mockup is NOT AS IMPORTANT as writing valid, semantic code. 

 

Create two additional HTML files, with different content in the main (gray background) and sidebar (purple background, on left) areas- this can be ipsum text, images, or whatever you like. Style them similarly to how the first page is styled (use your judgement). This should be an exercise in extending design concept from a mockup to real content.

 

Use git to commit your work as you go. Create a repository on Github called mockup-practice, and push your work up to it. Refer to class 1's slides if you need a refresher on Git & Github. When your site is complete, publish it to Github Pages. Refer to class 3's slides for a refresher on working with Github Pages.

I'll be viewing your page live and expect it to display properly (no broken images, etc). You will be graded on the quality of your HTML and CSS.
